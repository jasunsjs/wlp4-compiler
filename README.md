# WLP4 Compiler

This is a full compiler for a C/C++ like language called WLP4 that compiles WLP4 code to MIPS assembly. It is written in C++, and it includes the following:
- Scanner (Simplified Maximal Munch)
- Parser (SLR(1) algorithm)
- Type checker
- Code generator

Sample files test.wlp4 and test.asm are provided.

WLP4 is designed exclusively for the CS241 course at UWaterloo, as a simplified version of C++. Below are the official descriptions of WLP4:

- [WLP4 Programming Language Specification](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/WLP4.html)

Due to the University's policies, please contact privately at jjsun@uwaterloo.ca for the source code.
